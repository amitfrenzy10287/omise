 # Omise Code Challenges
+
+This repository houses Omise's interviewing code challenges. These are small hands-on
+projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on at Omise.
+
+### Ground Rules
+
+* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time if
+  you need it. A rush job is usually matched by a swift rejection.
+* Average completion time so far has been around one to two weeks.
+* Submission is done via a [git patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch)
+  facility. Attach your patch in an e-mail and send it to
+  [jobs@omise.co](mailto:jobs@omise.co).
+* Alternatively, you can also push it onto a GitHub public repository and send a link.
+
+
+### Challenges
+
+Pick the one that most suites the position you wish to apply.
+
+* Backend / Ruby on Rails - [tamboon-rails](https://git.omise.co/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-rails)
+* Frontend / React - [tamboon-react](https://git.omise.co/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-react)
+* Mobile App / iOS and Android - [tamboon-mobile](https://git.omise.co/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-mobile)
+
+### Free Style Challenge
+
+If you feel that none of the challenge is sufficient to demonstrate your coding ability,
+you can also choose to submit any project of your own choosing that you are proud of.
